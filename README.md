# The Perseus "Encyclopedia"

We chose this rather term in the late 1980s to describe the results of merging extensive back of the book indices for Herodotus, Pausanias and Pseudo-Apollodorus. It does include some alignment, e.g., entries for Ajax the son of Telamon and Ajax the son of Oileus from different indices are grouped together (as ajax-1 and ajax-2).

Citations to the prinary texts:

* Herodotus -- 5,110 passages
* Pseudo-Apollodorus -- 7,315 passages
* Pausanias -- 21,780 passages
